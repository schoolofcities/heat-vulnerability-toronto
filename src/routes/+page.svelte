			Climate change caused by human activity has altered temperature patterns across the world. Warming patterns in cities is a trend that we can project into the future in the form of more intense and frequent heatwaves. The effects of urban heat islands combined with the built nature and density of cities magnify harmful impacts of such warming on urban populations. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Vulnerability is “the propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected”. Heat vulnerability is impacted by a combination of heat exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Sensitivity is the susceptibility to potential harm from climate change hazards. Adaptive capacity describes the ability to adjust to potential climate change hazards, take advantage of opportunities, or respond to consequences. 
		</p>
		<h4>
			Heat Vulnerability = Heat Exposure + Sensitivity + Adaptive Capacity
		</h4>
		<p>
			Using Toronto as a case study, the maps below show how heat vulnerability can be quantified and how it varies across the city.
			The first map below is an overall heat vulnerability index. DESCRIBE PATTERNS.
		</p>
		
	</div>

	<Map index = "vulnerability" {showHospitals} {showCooling} {showPool} {showAptNoAir} />

	<div class="text">
		<p>
			This heat vulnerability index is calculated by combining data on sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and heat exposure, which are each also not uniformly distributed across the city. Communities experience climate change impact differently based on socio-economic factors as well as differences land use and land cover.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's look at maps for each of these components, starting with heat exposure. Heat degree days are used to represent heat exposure. Heat degree days are calculated by adding finding the average of cumulative temperatures over 20°c during a given period.
		</p>
		<p>
			The map below shows how heat exposure varies over the city. Areas with lower heat degree days tend to follow the edge of Lake Ontario and the ravines, waterways, and green spaces in the city. 
		</p>
	</div>

	<Map index = "heatdegree" {showHospitals} {showCooling} {showPool} {showAptNoAir} />

	<div class="text">
		<p>
			Sensitivity is the second component, and is a combination of tree canopy cover, impervious surface coverage, and population age in a neighbourhood.
		</p>
		<p>	
			Canopy cover relates to the cooling effect on surroundings by the presence of plants and trees, through evapotranspiration and shade. Impervious surface coverage refers to materials that determine heat exposure through the amount of heat and light that is absorbed or reflected. Age is correlated with sensitivity as older people have a higher mortality rate during extreme heat events, compared with any other age group. 
		</p>
	</div>

	<Map index = "sensitivity" {showHospitals} {showCooling} {showPool} {showAptNoAir} />

	<div class="text">
		<p>
			The third component in heat vulnerability is adaptive capacity. It refers to a household’s ability to access resources to alleviate the impacts of heat exposure, such as air conditioning. This capacity is affected by factors such as income, educational background, racial and ethnic background, language barriers, and the integrity and extent of social networks. This research uses census data related income, education, employment, language, visible minority, citizenship status, Indigenous population, housing age, etc., to establish the extent to which households are capable of adapting to heat. 
		</p>
		<p>
			An additional component of adaptive capacity is access to services such as medical and cooling centres. Proximity to services alleviates the impacts of heat exposure, so average distance to medical services and cooling centres are used in the calculation of the adaptive capacity index. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The spatial pattern in the map below generally follows that of the <a href="https://oahpp.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/44d0f17d5a0a45aeb47bcdb59902b37e" target = '_blank'>Ontario Marginalization Index</a> which uses census data to map health inequalities across the province. It also correlates closely with <a href="https://schoolofcities.github.io/neighbourhood-income-toronto-2020/" target = '_blank'>wealth and poverty in the city</a>. 
		</p>
	</div>

	<Map index = "adaptive" {showHospitals} {showCooling} {showPool} {showAptNoAir} />

	<div class="text">
		<p>
			Overall, these maps can help to identify communities and neighbourhoods that experience vulnerability to heatwaves. We can then develop place-specific strategies to adapt and mitigate outsized negative impacts on these communities. Some examples of these include expanding existing cooling spaces, medical services, and green spaces across the city. Actively measuring the impacts and assessing the effectiveness of mitigation strategies is a way to address heat vulnerability.
