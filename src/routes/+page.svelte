			Climate change presents many challenges for cities. With respect to heat, the impacts of global warming—such as the increasing frequency and severity of heat waves—are magnified in cities by the urban heat island effect, a phenomenon associated with the dense, built environments of cities. However, heat exposure is not the only thing that determines how vulnerable people and neighbourhoods are to heat.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines vulnerability as the propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected by a climate change hazard, such as heat. Here, heat vulnerability is a function of three components: heat exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Sensitivity is the susceptibility to potential harm from climate change hazards, and adaptive capacity describes the ability to adjust to potential climate change hazards, take advantage of opportunities, or respond to consequences.
		</p>
		<h4>
			Heat Vulnerability = Heat Exposure x ( Sensitivity - Adaptive Capacity)
		</h4>
		<p>
			Using Toronto as a case study, the maps below show how heat vulnerability can be quantified and how it varies across the city. The first map shows the overall heat vulnerability index. Below the maps are buttons for toggling on/off data on cooling centres and swimming pools, which can help alleviate impacts of extreme heat. There is also a layer for apartment buildings without central air conditioning. Many of these are home to low-income residents and recent immigrants.
		</p>
		
	</div>

	<Map index = "vulnerability" {showHospitals} {showCooling} {showPool} {showAptNoAir} />

	<div class="text">
		<p>
			This heat vulnerability index is calculated by combining data on sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and heat exposure, which are not uniformly distributed across the city. Communities are more or less vulnerable to heat based on demographic, socio-economic factors as well as differences in land use and greenspace.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's look at maps for each of these components, starting with heat exposure based on satellite-derived surface temperature. The cumulative metric, heat degree-days, is used to represent heat exposure. Heat degree-days are calculated by summing the degrees above 20°C for each pixel of the satellite image and dividing by the number of available measurements for that pixel over the 2010-2019 time period. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The map below shows how heat exposure varies over the city. Areas with lower heat degree-days tend to follow the edge of Lake Ontario and the ravines, waterways (such as the Don River) and green spaces.
		</p>
	</div>

	<Map index = "heatdegree" {showHospitals} {showCooling} {showPool} {showAptNoAir} />

	<div class="text">
		<p>
			Sensitivity is the second component. It is a combination of tree canopy cover, impervious surface coverage, and population age in a neighbourhood.
		</p>
		<p>	
			Tree canopy cover represents the cooling effect of trees on their surroundings through evapotranspiration and shade. Impervious surface coverage provides information about the presence of materials within the built environment that absorb and re-emit heat and can provide additional information about the presence or absence of green space. Age is an important sensitivity metric, as older people are more susceptible to heat stress and tend to have pre-existing health conditions that can exacerbate their physiological response to heat.
		</p>
		<p>
			A map of sensitivity is shown below, where the darker the colour, the more sensitive a neighbourhood is to heat.
		</p>
	</div>

	<Map index = "sensitivity" {showHospitals} {showCooling} {showPool} {showAptNoAir} />

	<div class="text">
		<p>
			The third component of heat vulnerability is adaptive capacity. This refers to a household's ability to access resources to alleviate the impacts of heat exposure, such as air conditioning. This capacity is affected by factors such as income, educational background, racial and ethnic background, language barriers, and the integrity and extent of social networks. This research uses census data on income, education, employment, language, visible minority status, citizenship status, Indigenous population, housing age, etc., to establish the extent to which households can adapt to heat.
		</p>
		<p>
			The adaptive capacity component also includes data related to access to services such as medical and cooling centres. Proximity to services can alleviate the impacts of heat exposure, so the average distance to medical services and cooling centres are used in the calculation of the adaptive capacity index.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the map below, the darker the colour, the greater capacity of the neighbourhood to adapt to extreme heat events. The spatial pattern generally follows a similar component of the <a href="https://oahpp.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/44d0f17d5a0a45aeb47bcdb59902b37e" target = '_blank'>Ontario Marginalization Index</a> which uses census data to map health inequalities across the province. It also correlates closely with <a href="https://schoolofcities.github.io/neighbourhood-income-toronto-2020/" target = '_blank'>wealth and poverty in the city</a>.

		<p>
			Overall, these maps can help identify communities and neighbourhoods in Toronto that experience greater vulnerability to heat and can inform place-specific strategies to adapt to and mitigate disproportionate negative impacts on these communities. Some examples of these include expanding existing cooling spaces, medical services, and green spaces across the city. Actively measuring the impacts and assessing the effectiveness of mitigation strategies can help address heat vulnerability as the climate continues to warm.
